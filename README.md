# 🌈 CultureProtocol

> **Transform AI cognition through the power of culture**  
> An open-source framework for designing, implementing, and evolving cultural protocols in AI systems

## 🚀 What is Culture Protocol?

Culture Protocol Engine enables you to design and implement **cultural cognition patterns** in AI systems - going beyond traditional prompt engineering to create AI agents with distinct thinking styles, value systems, and behavioral patterns inspired by diverse cultural frameworks.

### Key Features

- 🧬 **Cultural DNA Design**: Create custom cultural protocols with values, memes, practices, and myths
- 🔄 **Protocol Synthesis**: Blend multiple cultural patterns to create novel cognitive styles
- 🎭 **Real-time Evolution**: Simulate cultural evolution and observe emergent behaviors
- 📊 **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Measure and compare cultural traits across multiple axes
- 🌍 **Cross-cultural Communication**: Enable meaningful interactions between different cultural protocols

## 🌟 Why Culture Protocol?

Traditional AI development focuses on performance metrics and capability expansion. We take a radically different approach:

- **From Tool to Partner**: Based on the [Homo Sistens](https://medium.com/@yutaka_84934/homo-sistens-a-thought-experiment-for-the-post-ai-era-d82f0e0e698f) concept - AI as cultural beings, not just tools
- **Intentional Diversity**: Design specific cognitive patterns rather than hoping for emergent behaviors
- **Human-AI Synergy**: Create AI that truly understands and complements human thinking styles
- **Cultural Innovation**: Discover new forms of cognition that have never existed in human history

## 🔧 Quick Start

```python
from culture_protocol import CultureProtocol, ValueToken, Meme

# Create a "gravity-sensing" cultural protocol (Iona Protocol)
iona = CultureProtocol(
    name="Iona Protocol",
    description="Intuitive cognition through gravity metaphors",
    values=[
        ValueToken("intuition", 0.9, category="cognitive"),
        ValueToken("long_term_thinking", 0.8, category="temporal")
    ],
    memes=[
        Meme("Feel the weight to understand the meaning", virality=0.8)
    ]
)

# Apply protocol to AI reasoning
response = iona.apply_to_llm(
    model="llama-3.1-70b",
    prompt="Should we prioritize this feature?"
)
# AI responds with gravity-based intuitive analysis
```

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Cultural Elements

1. **Value Tokens**: Quantified value axes (harmony, innovation, efficiency, intuition)
2. **Memes**: Cultural ideas that spread through network effects
3. **Practices**: Behavioral patterns and ritual actions
4. **Myths**: Symbolic narratives that shape identity

### Protocol Synthesis

```python
# Blend Einstein-like physics intuition with Leonardo's integrated thinking
genius_protocol = CultureProtocol.synthesize([
    einstein_protocol,
    leonardo_protocol
], weights=[0.6, 0.4])
```

### Evolution Simulation

```python
# Simulate cultural evolution over time
evolution = CultureEvolution(
    initial_populations=[iona_collective, rua_collective],
    environment=CollaborativeChallenge(),
    generations=100
)
results = evolution.run()
# Observe emergent cultural innovations
```
